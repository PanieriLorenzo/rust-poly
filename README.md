Numeric manipulation of real and complex polynomials.

> Note: this crate is still in development and might change in the future.

Basic Goals:
- [x] addition, subtraction and multiplication of complex and real univariate polynomials
- [x] long division of complex and real univariate polynomials
- [x] finding complex roots of polynomials
- [x] generate chebyshev polynomials
- [ ] indexing, slicing and iterating
- [x] from/into traits

Future Goals:
- [ ] Serde integration
- [ ] Random integration
- [ ] Real polynomial type
- [ ] Rational functions
