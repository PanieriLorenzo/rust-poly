# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.4.0] - 2024-08-26

### 🚀 Features

- [**breaking**] Removed dependency on `nalgebra` and related methods
- [**breaking**] Relaxed trait bounds for `RealScalar` to allow non-floats
- [**breaking**] Use f128 in `roots` for higher precision

### 🚜 Refactor

- Use `f128` type internally for higher precision

## [0.3.0] - 2024-08-24

### 🚀 Features

- [**breaking**] Redid `Poly::roots` entirely, now it's much more stable and efficient
- [**breaking**] Made the `Poly::from` trait impls less ambiguous
- [**breaking**] Changed how zero polynomials are represented
- [**breaking**] `eval_point` renamed to `eval`, `eval` renamed to `eval_multiple`
- [**breaking**] Changed `eval_multiple` to have an output buffer
- [**breaking**] Use a slice for indexing instead of re-inventing the wheel (removed `Get` trait)
- [**breaking**] Custom error type for root finders
- [**breaking**] Assert that testing api is not used in production
- New procedural root finder API (in the `roots` module)
    - `halley` root finder
    - `newton` root finder
    - `naive` root finder (Newton without variable stepsize and local-minimum detection)
    - `aberth_ehrlich` root finder
    - `parallel` root finder (runs `newton` or `halley` in parallel)
    - `initial_guess_circle`
- Relax bounds on `T` for `Poly<T>`
- Removed dependency `duplicate`
- Added `diff` and `integral`
- `translate` method to move polynomial on x and y axes
- Added `legendre` polynomials
- Impl `std::fmt::Display` for `Poly`
- Added `shift_up` and `shift_down` methods for changing degrees of polynomial
- `SafeConstants` trait for better numeric precision
- Improve precision of `eval` (at the expense of some speed)
- Added `from_real_iterator` and `from_complex_iterator`

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Potential bug in `poly!` macro, making nested complex numbers by accident
- Removed debug print from `bessel`
- `Poly::div_rem` was completely wrong
- `normalize` converted constant 0 to zero polynomial
- `diff` produced a zero polynomial instead of a constant zero on constant polynomials
- Math error in `Poly::companion` (closes #3)
- Roots accidentally required `na::Scalar` instead of `crate::Scalar`
- Root finders use exact solutions for linear and quadratic polynomials
- `poly` macro now works without having to import `num::Zero`
- `div_rem` stuck in endless loop if divisor is 1
- Multiple bugs preventing trivial polynomial roots to be found
- Removed old test relying on `plotters`, now that we use `plotly` instead
- Over 60 lints and warnings
- Cargo clippy fixes
